>Gaming has been the fascination of a large population for decades. Even before the creation of Video Games 
in 1962, outdoor sports and interactive board games were found to be extremely amusing and would relieve 
stresses for the people involved. This interest in games soon shifted from outdoor games to indoor excursions
on computerized systems which lead to online gaming as we see it today. But these games were not always the
way we see them. Years before they were completely computerized, these games were played in arcades and 
gaming centers on systems which were made especially for them. This time period essentially came to be
known as the retro gaming era. The apex of all retro games, is the Mighty Pac Man.<br><br>The big Yellow pie 
shaped man goes around a maze trying to eat as many dots as possible. Keeping Pac Man’s legacy in mind
and adding a few of our own changes, we present to you: The Maze Chaser. As players eat all pink balls,
they are judged on the time taken by them to do so. The player taking the least amount of time to eat 
all other balls, wins. Players may choose between 3 different, unique levels and play to reignite the 
excitement of playing on the Pac Man. Team horizon games thus wishes you all the very best and explicitly
tells you: Don’t trifle with a heavyweight.
